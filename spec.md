# Claude Code Harness V2 Spec

Status: active SSOT as of v1.0.0
Last updated: 2026-07-20

This file is the root product contract for Claude Code Harness V2.
Plans.md is the task ledger. `spec.md` is the product contract.
`spec.md` says what must stay true.

## Purpose

V2 makes Harness a faster operator workflow without weakening evidence.

The goal is to reduce human planning and verification load by letting Harness:

- classify work before execution,
- lock the correct specification before implementation,
- require TDD evidence when behavior changes,
- route review depth by risk,
- create PR-ready evidence packs,
- preserve release-grade checks for public artifacts,
- onboard users through the tool they already use, while only claiming support
  that has adapter evidence,
- keep repo-health gates such as formatting, linting, release preflight, and
  host runtime smoke aligned with the support tier being claimed.

### North Star (3 layers)

The ambition stacks oldest-foundation-first; each layer is the ground for the next.

- **L1 Judgment-only operation**: AI prepares the plan, implementation,
  comparison, and verification evidence; the operator (human) makes only the
  final judgment. (Foundation, already the Purpose above.)
- **L2 Enforcement**: one Harness (R01-R13 guardrails +
  plan/work/review/release) applies through Claude Code's native hooks.
  A single policy engine adjudicates the host — routing, not duplication.
- **L3 Collaboration (future north star)**: multiple agents co-drive the same
  project without making the human a copy-paste courier. Mode 1 = full
  autonomous orchestration (Lead = Claude, fixed) is the shipped form. Full
  peer-Lead collaboration is staged in later.

## HOTL Governance Contract

This contract makes North Star **L3** concrete for the **personal harness** (this
repo). Organization-scope governance (shared constitution, team standards) lives
in **ContextHarness V2**; CCH inherits that constitution and governs only one
operator's autonomous loop. The goal is **Human-on-the-Loop**: the operator
supervises from outside the loop instead of approving every gate (HITL).

Status: **verification-first**. No autonomy rollout — and no phased adoption
ladder — until the U0-U7 governance prerequisites are proven with evidence.
Autonomy is the *output* of a proven harness, not the starting point.

Invariants (each must become machine-checkable before the matching autonomy is
enabled):

1. **Deterministic-first judiciary.** Deterministic checks (tests, R01-R14, RTM
   coverage) hold the binding verdict (veto). LLM semantic review is advisory
   only and can never raise a gate above the deterministic layer. A unanimous
   cross-model APPROVE is corroborating advice, not proof (judge errors are
   correlated; verdicts are non-deterministic even at temperature 0).
2. **SSOT vs derived separation.** Human-approved sources (rules, spec, tests)
   are the only judgment basis. Derived artifacts (provenance maps, graphs,
   generated HTML, summaries) are navigation only, carry a `derived` marker, are
   git-ignored where generated, and must never feed back into the executor's
   decisions.
3. **Three-axis escalation.** The loop escalates to the human on (a) final
   spec/UX change, (b) security risk, OR (c) blast-radius / irreversibility
   (deletes, file/dir count over threshold, cross-repo, non-revertible ops).
   Axis (c) is machine-detectable and is the outer backstop, because (a)/(b) are
   semantic and an agent self-classifies them unreliably.
4. **In-run scope leash (zero human-load).** During execution every tool-use is
   checked against the task's declared scope. The scope is **auto-inferred** from
   the plan (task target files + RTM) — the operator never hand-declares a file
   allowlist. Out-of-scope writes raise an alarm/escalation; declared-but-
   untouched scope (dropped work) is flagged. This catches task drift and silent
   failures that a terminal review structurally cannot see.
   The same Runtime Floor has a symmetric secret-read allowlist contract for
   local files, matching the egress allowlist enforced by `isAllowlistedHost`:
   network egress is denied unless the destination host is explicitly declared,
   and secret reads are denied unless the exact path is explicitly declared.
   The only relaxation secret-read allowlisting provides is for named paths; it
   must never mean broad filesystem access. Empty strings, a bare `*`, or any
   other all-open declaration are invalid and resolve to deny. Effective
   declarations are the union of `HARNESS_RUNTIME_FLOOR_SECRET_ALLOW` and the
   project config `.harness.config.json` key
   `runtimefloor.secretAllow`. If project config is unreadable, malformed, or
   has an invalid `runtimefloor.secretAllow` shape, the fail-safe behavior is an
   empty allowlist (all secret reads denied). Relative paths resolve under the
   project root; absolute paths outside the project root are invalid and ignored.
5. **Bounded, externally-anchored review.** The OK-until-clean loop is capped
   (e.g. 3 rounds) with human escalation on repeated same-cause failure. Severity
   is a fixed taxonomy: security / data-loss / correctness findings always block
   and are never eligible for "stop nitpicking, move on"; only style/preference
   may be suppressed. Independent fresh-context review (the implementer's work
   reviewed in a separate context) is required; when that independent leg is
   unavailable it is a named reduced-autonomy state, not a silent same-context
   fallback.
6. **Constitution and self-modification protection.** Rule definitions
   (`rules.go`), `deny-baseline`, settings files, and `self-audit` policy are an
   untouchable class: no AI path may modify them; human-only. The audit trail of
   autonomous decisions is derived mechanically from an immutable event log, not
   from agent self-narration. A kill switch (`~/.harness/HALT`) denies all tool
   use ahead of any LLM judgment.

Prose-quality governance is scoped, not universal. Only the deterministic
banned-phrase subset (empty LLM-filler
strings) is eligible to become a gate, proven first as the reference instance of
rule↔check provenance (invariant 1). Semantic writing rules (causal-mechanism,
hedge-preservation, single-cause reduction) stay advisory and never veto.
Orthographic preferences such as the em-dash ban are loose recommendations, never
gates — a prose gate that fired on the agent's own output would deadlock the
in-run leash with no slack. There is one prose SSOT, not three overlapping ones.

Reuse over reinvention: rule↔check and feature→requirement→proof traceability is
the mature discipline of policy-as-code (OPA/Conftest) and Requirements
Traceability Matrices (DO-178C / ISO 26262); tamper-evidence is in-toto / SLSA.
CCH adopts these rather than rebuilding them. The genuinely novel scope is
**self-referential governance**: an agent that edits its own harness and could
game its own grader.

## Users And Workflows

Primary user:

- An operator who prefers AI to prepare the plan, implementation, comparison,
  and verification evidence, while the operator makes the final judgment.

Core workflows:

- Plan: turn intent into a scoped, reviewable contract.
- Work: implement only approved slices, with deterministic checks.
- Review: route review depth by risk and preserve evidence.
- Sync: reconcile Plans, git state, mirrors, and distribution surfaces.
- Release: package evidence and publish only after release-grade gates pass.

## SSOT Layers

`spec.md` is the root product contract and keeps the stable core readable.
Detailed contracts live under `docs/spec/` and are part of the same product
contract. `Plans.md` records scheduled work and evidence, but it does not weaken
or override the spec.

SSOT precedence:

Anchor: spec.md > sub-spec > Plans.md.

1. `spec.md` core: North Star, HOTL governance, global invariants, SSOT order,
   non-goals, and open decisions.
2. `docs/spec/*` sub-specs: detailed contract chapters linked from this file.
3. `Plans.md`: task ledger, implementation sequencing, and verification notes.
4. `CHANGELOG.md` / README / skill prose: distribution-facing summaries.

When a detail moves from `spec.md` into `docs/spec/*`, it remains spec material.
If a sub-spec conflicts with this core, this core wins until a human-approved spec
update changes the order.

## Planning Surface Contract

Planning produces co-required planning output: the `spec.md` product contract and Plans.md task contract.
Anchor: spec.md product contract and Plans.md task contract.
Every `create` output and every product-impacting `/harness-plan add` must produce either `Spec delta` or `Spec skip reason`, and must produce the spec result before producing task rows. Harness generates the spec result; the consumer approves or edits it.
Unknown data follows `not_observed != absent`; do not infer absence from missing evidence.

Non-trivial planning must be team-validated. TeamAgent or sub-agent perspectives are required when available, and the output must record `team_validation_mode`. Non-trivial work must use `native`, `subagent`, or `manual-pass`; Product / Architecture / Security / QA / Skeptic are perspectives, not required runtime `agent_type` names. Planning must include a project-scoped harness-mem / harness-recall / repo-memory wheel check, security validation for permissions, secrets, external sends, supply chain, and works-in-practice validation. Security validation must not require reading secrets.

Related sub-spec anchors: `docs/architecture/hokage-core.md`, `go/SPEC.md`, Host Adapter Boundary, Support Tiers And Host Claims, Onboarding Contract, New Session Bootstrap Rule, and `future/unsupported` host claim handling.

The chapter names above intentionally preserve the old `spec.md` headings so grep
based audits can still find the contract location from the core file.

## Non-Goals

1. No automatic implementation without an approved plan.
2. No release claim without a matching support-tier gate.
3. No silent fallback from independent fresh-context review to same-context review.
4. No derived artifact may become a judgment source.
5. No host-specific distribution may load another host's private compatibility
   surface by accident.
6. No AI path may modify constitution files or self-audit policy.

## Open Decisions

- Full peer-Lead collaboration remains staged. Live peer-to-peer notice
  messaging was removed before v1.0.0; L3 work resumes from Mode 1
  orchestration when a peer transport is justified by real use.
- Organization-scope governance remains outside this repo and belongs to
  ContextHarness V2.
- Broader prose-quality gates must prove deterministic value before promotion;
  semantic prose rules stay advisory.
