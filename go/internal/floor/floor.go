// Package floor implements the PRE-MERGE POLICY GATE (Phase 91.6 "FLOOR") — the
// universal integration-time file gate that an untrusted (codex) backend's
// changes must pass before they are cherry-picked into the trunk.
//
// This is distinct from the RUNTIME ACTION HARD FLOOR in go/internal/runtimefloor,
// which pattern-matches Bash commands before a worker action runs and always
// escalates five non-overridable categories to a human.
//
// Non-Claude backends produce changes that are untrusted until they clear the
// harness's guardrails. The FLOOR is the mandatory gate that runs, in order:
//
//  1. policy.VerifyDenySurface() — chain integrity. The deny rules that
//     constrain the agent must not have been weakened; if they have, nothing
//     downstream can be trusted to adjudicate, so the gate fails immediately.
//  2. policy check over the candidate changed files — each file is evaluated as
//     a write through the real R01-R13 engine; a deny means the take-in is
//     refused.
//  3. the contract greps — test-support-claim-wording.sh, check-consistency.sh,
//     validate-plugin.sh — which encode repo-wide invariants (support-claim
//     wording, mirror/consistency, plugin structure).
//
// ALL steps must pass for the gate to pass. The ScriptRunner seam keeps step 3
// injectable so tests never shell out.
