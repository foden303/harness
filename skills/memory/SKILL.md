| **Memory → SSOT promotion** | See [references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md) |

## Unified Harness Memory (shared DB)

For recording and searching shared across Claude Code sessions, prefer the `harness_mem_*` MCP.

- Search: `harness_mem_search`, `harness_mem_timeline`, `harness_mem_get_observations`
- Injection: `harness_mem_resume_pack`
- Recording: `harness_mem_record_checkpoint`, `harness_mem_finalize_session`, `harness_mem_record_event`

## Relationship to Claude Code Auto-Memory (D22)

Harness's SSOT memory (Layer 2) coexists with Claude Code's auto-memory (Layer 1).
Auto-memory implicitly records general learnings, while the SSOT explicitly manages
project-specific decisions. When a Layer 1 insight is important to the whole project,
promote it to Layer 2 with `/memory ssot`.

## Execution Steps

1. Classify the user's request
2. Read the appropriate reference file from "Feature Details" above
3. Execute according to its contents

## SSOT Promotion

Persist important learnings from the memory system (Claude-mem / Serena) into the SSOT.
